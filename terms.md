# Terms and Conditions ("Terms") for Currencies

Effective Date: November 30, 2025

Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the Currencies mobile application (the "App") operated by its developer (referred to as "us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the App is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the App.

By accessing or using the App you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the App.

### 1. The Service

Currencies is a free-to-use mobile application designed to provide currency conversion calculations based on exchange rate data sourced from our proprietary API, fxpulse.dev.

### 2. Disclaimer on Exchange Rate Data

##### A. Data Accuracy and Frequency

The exchange rate data provided by the App is sourced from a third-party provider and is updated approximately once per hour.

The rates are NOT real-time and should not be used for high-frequency trading, immediate foreign exchange transactions, or any purpose requiring absolute, minute-by-minute accuracy.

We make no warranty, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or suitability of the exchange rate data for any particular purpose.

##### B. Financial Advice

The information provided by the App does not constitute financial, investment, or legal advice.

You acknowledge and agree that you must consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions based on the information provided by the App.

### 3. Intellectual Property

The App, its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of the developer. The App is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of Australia and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without our prior written consent.

### 4. Prohibited Uses

You agree not to use the App:

For any illegal purpose or in connection with any financial activities that violate the law.

To reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any aspect of the App.

To scrape, crawl, or use any automated means (such as bots or scripts) to access or copy data, content, or features of the App, including the currency rates.

To transmit any data or content that is abusive, harassing, threatening, harmful, or defamatory.

To interfere with the proper working of the App or the network on which it operates.

### 5. Termination

We may terminate or suspend access to our App immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, if you breach the Terms.

All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

### 6. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall the developer, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:

(i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the App;

(ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the App;

(iii) any unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage.

### 7. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Australia, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Australia to resolve any dispute arising out of these Terms or the App.

### 8. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

By continuing to access or use our App after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the App.
