# Privacy Policy for Currencies

Effective Date: November 30, 2025

This Privacy Policy informs you regarding our policies concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our application, Currencies (the "App"), and the choices you have associated with that data.

We use your data to provide and improve the App. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

### 1. Data Controller Information

The App is managed and operated by its developer.

App Name: Currencies

Contact Email for Privacy Questions: support@fxpulse.dev

### 2. Information Collection and Use

The App, Currencies, is designed to function with maximum anonymity and privacy.

##### A. Personal Data

We do not collect any Personal Data from users.

"Personal Data" means data about a living individual who can be identified from that data (or from those and other information either in our possession or likely to come into our possession). Currencies does not require you to create an account, provide personal information, or register in any way. Any StoreKit purchases (such as removing ads or sending tips) are processed directly by Apple. We do not receive any Personal Data from Apple during these purchases.

##### B. Usage Data

We do not use analytics tools (such as Google Analytics or Firebase) to track your behavior or identify you.

The App may process technical information locally on your device (e.g., your selected currencies or preferences) solely to operate the App. This information is not transmitted to us or any third party.

### 3. Storage and Security of Data

We do not collect or store Personal Data.

Any data processed within the App is stored only on your device and is protected by your device's operating system.

### 4. Third-Party Services and Advertising

##### A. Google AdMob (Non-Personalized Ads Only)

Currencies uses Google AdMob to display ads.
To protect your privacy, the App requests only non-personalized ads, meaning:
Google does not use your behavior across apps or websites to target ads
Ads are based solely on contextual information (e.g., app category, general region)
No identifiers are used to build advertising profiles
Google may still receive basic device data required for delivering non-personalized ads (e.g., IP address, device type). This data is processed under Google’s privacy policy.

##### B. In-App Purchases

The App offers optional StoreKit purchases:
Remove Ads: a non-consumable purchase that disables all advertising within the App
Tips: voluntary in-app purchases that support the developer
All purchases are handled by Apple through the App Store.
We do not receive any payment details or personal purchaser information.

### 5. Children's Privacy

The App does not target children under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect any Personal Data from any user.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted within the App with a new “Effective Date.”

You are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
