# 🔒 Privacy Policy for Currencies

Effective Date: November 17, 2025

This Privacy Policy informs you regarding our policies concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our application, Currencies (the "App"), and the choices you have associated with that data.

We use your data to provide and improve the App. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

### 1. Data Controller Information

The App is managed and operated by its developer.

App Name: Currencies

Contact Email for Privacy Questions: support@fxpulse.dev

### 2. Information Collection and Use

The App, Currencies, is designed to function with maximum anonymity and privacy.

##### A. Personal Data

We do not collect any Personal Data from users.

"Personal Data" means data about a living individual who can be identified from that data (or from those and other information either in our possession or likely to come into our possession). Since the App does not require account creation, payment, or the input of personal identifiers, no such data is collected or processed.

##### B. Usage Data

We do not use any third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics or Firebase) to track or record your usage of the App.

We may temporarily process non-personally identifiable technical information locally on your device (such as the currency pairs you select) purely to deliver the core functionality of the currency conversion service. This technical data is not transmitted to us or any third party.

### 3. Storage and Security of Data

Since we do not collect, store, or transmit any Personal Data, the risks associated with data breaches are mitigated.

The only information processed is stored locally on your device and is subject to the security measures of your operating system (iOS, Android, etc.).

### 4. Third-Party Services and Advertising

Currencies does not rely on any third-party services for advertising or analytics.

There are no advertisements in the App.

We do not use third-party analytics tools (like Google Analytics, Firebase, or similar services).

### 5. Children's Privacy

The App does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children").

As we do not knowingly collect any Personal Data from anyone, we certainly do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children have provided us with Personal Data, please contact us.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
