# Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How often are the exchange rates updated?

Our exchange rates are refreshed hourly. This ensures you always have the most current and reliable data for your conversions. The last successful update time is always visible within the app.

### 2. How reliable is the offline mode?

The offline mode is extremely reliable! When the app updates (hourly, or whenever you manually refresh), it stores the latest rates on your device. This allows you to perform unlimited conversions instantly, even if you are on a flight, in a remote location, or have your phone in airplane mode. You can even add a currency offline !

### 3. Why are the rates in the app slightly different from Google or my bank?

This is normal! We use interbank rates, which are real-time, wholesale rates used between financial institutions.

Banks and Credit Cards use their own proprietary rates and almost always add a margin or "fee" on top of the interbank rate.

Google/Search Engines often pull data from different sources which may have a slight delay or use an average.

Our rates are designed to be a highly accurate base for comparison and budgeting.

### 4. How do I control my mobile data usage?

The app gives you full control over data. You can find the data settings within the app menu, where you can choose between:

- Wi-Fi Only updates (Default): Rates will only refresh when your device is connected to a Wi-Fi network.
- Automatic updates : Uses a small amount of data every hour.
- Manual Refresh: You must pull to refresh to get new rates.

### 5. Does the app support cryptocurrencies or precious metals?

While we are focused on providing the best experience for standard fiat currencies (USD, EUR, AUD, etc.), we are constantly evaluating new features. Please contact us below if you have a specific currency request!
